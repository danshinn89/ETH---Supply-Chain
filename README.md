# ETH-Supply-Chain
Simple supply chain running on Ethereum. Allows the owner to create an item that is then given its own unique address. 
This allows the customer to send the price of the item to the smart contract. 
The smart contract then updates the Supply chain state of the item (Created, paid, delivered) and moves it further in the chain. 
The owner can only change the item to delivered.  

Clone and test the contract using:

truffle test
